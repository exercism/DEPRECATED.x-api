This is your first error message.\n.\nFirst it tells you the name of the file where the error is occurring:\n\n    bob_test.rb\n.\nThen it tells you which line that error is on:\n\n    bob_test.rb:4\n.\nAfter that, it tells you the name of the method where the error is occurring:\n\n    in `require_relative'\n.\nNext, it tells you exactly what the error is:\n\n    #{e.message.split('--').first}\n.\nFinally, it tells you which file is missing:\n\n    #{e.message.split('--').last}\n.\nSo the error is there on line 4 of this file (bob_test.rb).  What's on line 4?\n\n    require_relative 'bob'\n\nWe are trying to require the file, and it isn't there.\n.\nYou can fix the problem by creating an empty file named bob.rb inside\nof the ruby/bob directory.\n\nThen run this test again (ruby bob_test.rb).  Make all the tests pass,\nand submit your solution (exercism submit bob.rb).\n\nMore instructions are in README.md in this directory. Good luck!\n",
        "README.md": "# Bob\n\nBob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.\n\nBob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.\n\nHe answers 'Woah, chill out!' if you yell at him.\n\nHe says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.\n\nHe answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.\n\n## Instructions\n\nRun the test file, and fix each of the errors in turn. When you get the first test to pass, go to the first pending or skipped test, and make that pass as well. When all of the tests are passing, feel free to submit.\n\nRemember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make it.\n\nPlease make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.\n\nHave fun!\n\n\n\n## Source\n\nInspired by the 'Deaf Grandma' exercise in Chris Pine's Learn to Program tutorial.

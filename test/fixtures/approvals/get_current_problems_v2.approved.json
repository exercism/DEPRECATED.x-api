Good code doesn't just\npass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the\nspecification.\n\nHave fun!\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nMake sure you have read the [getting started with C++](http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-cpp.html)\npage on the [exercism help site](http://help.exercism.io/).  This covers\nthe basic information on setting up the development environment expected\nby the exercises.\n\n## Passing the Tests\n\nGet the first test compiling, linking and passing by following the [three\nrules of test-driven development](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd).\nCreate just enough structure by declaring namespaces, functions, classes,\netc., to satisfy any compiler errors and get the test to fail.  Then write\njust enough code to get the test to pass.  Once you've done that,\nuncomment the next test by moving the following line past the next test.\n\n```C++\n#if defined(EXERCISM_RUN_ALL_TESTS)\n```\n\nThis may result in compile errors as new constructs may be invoked that\nyou haven't yet declared or defined.  Again, fix the compile errors minimally\nto get a failing test, then change the code minimally to pass the test,\nrefactor your implementation for readability and expressiveness and then\ngo on to the next test.\n\nTry to use standard C++11 facilities in preference to writing your own\nlow-level algorithms or facilities by hand.  [CppReference](http://en.cppreference.com/)\nis a wiki reference to the C++ language and standard library.  If you\nare new to C++, but have programmed in C, beware of\n[C traps and pitfalls](http://www.slideshare.net/LegalizeAdulthood/c-traps-and-pitfalls-for-c-programmers).\n\n## Source\n\nInspired by the 'Deaf Grandma' exercise in Chris Pine's Learn to Program tutorial.

        "README.md": "# Etl\n\nWe are going to do the `Transform` step of an Extract-Transform-Load.\n\n### ETL\nExtract-Transform-Load (ETL) is a fancy way of saying, \"We have some crufty, legacy data over in this system, and now we need it in this shiny new system over here, so\nwe're going to migrate this.\"\n\n(Typically, this is followed by, \"We're only going to need to run this\nonce.\" That's then typically followed by much forehead slapping and\nmoaning about how stupid we could possibly be.)\n\n### The goal\nWe're going to extract some scrabble scores from a legacy system.\n\nThe old system stored a list of letters per score:\n\n- 1 point: \"A\", \"E\", \"I\", \"O\", \"U\", \"L\", \"N\", \"R\", \"S\", \"T\",\n- 2 points: \"D\", \"G\",\n- 3 points: \"B\", \"C\", \"M\", \"P\",\n- 4 points: \"F\", \"H\", \"V\", \"W\", \"Y\",\n- 5 points: \"K\",\n- 8 points: \"J\", \"X\",\n- 10 points: \"Q\", \"Z\",\n\nThe shiny new scrabble system instead stores the score per letter, which\nmakes it much faster and easier to calculate the score for a word. It\nalso stores the letters in lower-case regardless of the case of the\ninput letters:\n\n- \"a\" is worth 1 point.\n- \"b\" is worth 3 points.\n- \"c\" is worth 3 points.\n- \"d\" is worth 2 points.\n- Etc.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write a program that\ntransforms the legacy data format to the shiny new format.\n\n### Notes\nNote that both the old and the new system use strings to represent\nletters, even in languages that have a separate data type for\ncharacters. \n\nA final note about scoring, Scrabble is played around the world in a\nvariety of languages, each with its own unique scoring table. For\nexample, an \"A\" is scored at 14 in the Basque-language version of the\ngame while being scored at 9 in the Latin-language version.\n\n\n## Source\n\nThe Jumpstart Lab team [view source](http://jumpstartlab.com)\n"

        "GETTING_STARTED.md": "# Getting Started\n\nThese exercises lean on Test-Driven Development (TDD), but they're not an\nexact match.\n\n## Setup\n\nYou'll need access to a mounted Oracle DB. If you don't have one already\ninstalled, here are a few options:\n* download VirtualBox from Oracle and run one of the freely\navailable images; at the time of writing, the easiest to get started with\nat the time of writing might be _Database App Development VM_. The\nimage is quite large...\n* download and install the a version of the Oracle DB itself. Developer licenses\nare free.\n* get a free workspace at https://apex.oracle.com\n\n**Note**: if you're using the online version of APEX, compilation errors will\nnot be indicated very clearly when working in _SQL Commands_ - you will simply\nget \"Error at line XX: PL/SQL: Statement ignored\"... More insight can be\nfound using the _Object Browser_ and navigating to the object you created\n(select either _Packages_ or _Procedures_ in the dropdown menu showing _Tables_,\ndepending on what you created for the exercise). Also, when you run statements,\n\"run\" each individual `create` statement individually by selecting its text.\nAPEX does not seem to like doing too much work at once...\n\nTo work on individual problems, a nice and free way is to use SQL Developer. If \nyou don't want to use yet another IDE, you can simply copy and paste your code\ninto a terminal / command prompt connected to the database. The files are\nprepared in a way that will simply overwrite the previously compiled version.\n\n#Exercise\n\n## Step 1\n\nCompile the test suite. You can easily do that by copy / pasting (let's call\nthat _installing_ for simplicity) into your terminal connected to a mounted\nOracle database.\n\nThis will fail, complaining that there is no package called `HAMMING#`.\n\nTo fix the error create the package by installing the prepared solution stub.\nNote that you will have to re-install the package body of `UT_HAMMING#`.\n\nA few words about naming: the `#` at the end of the name signifies that this\nis a package. `UT` means _unit test_. _PL/SQL_ has a maximum identifier length\nof 30 characters, which is why you will find that many words are abbreviated.\n\nIf you've worked with PL/SQL before, you might wonder why the template is a\npackage and not simply a standalone function. That would of course also be a\npossibility, but in practice standalone procedures or functions are rarely used.\n\n## Step 2\n\nTry to run the test. You will notice that you are missing the function's\nimplementation. Create it (see the test package for examples).\n\nNote that functions have to return a value, so for now just `return null;`.\n\n## Step 3\n\nRun the test again. It should now execute, but the test will fail.\nThat's where you get to actually implement the function!\n\n## Wash, Rinse, Repeat\n\nOnly the first test is enabled at first, the others are commented out. To enable\nthem, simply delete the `--` in front of the procedure call and they'll run\nwhen you next install the test package!\n\n## Submit\n\nWhen everything is passing, you can submit your code with the following\ncommand:\n\n    $ exercism submit hamming#.plsql\n\n",

It's in Minitest, and can be run with ruby:\n\n    $ ruby hamming_test.rb\n\nThis will fail, complaining that there is no file called `hamming`.\n\nTo fix the error create an empty file called `hamming.rb` in the same\ndirectory as the `hamming_test.rb` file.\n\n## Step 2\n\nRun the test again. It will give you a new error.\n\n\n    1) Error:\n    HammingTest#test_no_difference_between_identical_strands:\n    NameError: uninitialized constant Hamming\n        hamming_test.rb:12:in `test_no_difference_between_identical_strands'\n\nWithin the first test, we are referencing a constant named `Hamming` when\nwe say `Hamming.compute('A', 'A')`. When Ruby sees a capitalized name like\n`Hamming`, it looks it up in a big huge list of all the constants it knows about,\nto see what it points to. It could point to anything, and often in Ruby we have\nconstants that point to definitions of classes or modules.\n\nWhen it looks `Hamming` up in it's list, it doesn't find anything, so we need to make\none.\n\nThere are several ways that this error message can be made to go\naway, one of which is to define a `Hamming` class.\n\nOpen up the hamming.rb file and add the following code:\n\n    class Hamming\n    end\n\n## Step 3\n\nRun the test again.\n\n    1) Error:\n    HammingTest#test_no_difference_between_identical_strands:\n    NoMethodError: undefined method `compute' for #<Hamming:0x007fa531343e50>\n        hamming_test.rb:12:in `test_no_difference_between_identical_strands'\n\n\nThis time we have a `Hamming`, but we're trying tell it to `compute`, and\n`Hamming` doesn't understand that message.\n\nOpen up hamming.rb and add a method definition inside the class:\n\n    class Hamming\n      def self.compute\n      end\n    end\n\n## Step 4\n\nRun the test again.\n\n    1) Error:\n    HammingTest#test_no_difference_between_identical_strands:\n    ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (2 for 0)\n      in `compute' hamming_test.rb:12:in `test_no_difference_between_identical_strands'\n\nThe method `compute` needs to take two arguments.\n\nThese are examples of method definitions that take arguments:\n\n    def self.greet(name)\n    end\n\n    def self.drink(beverage,size)\n    end\n\nChange the `compute` method definition so it takes two arguments.\n\n## Step 5\n\nRun the test again.\n\n    1) Failure:\n    HammingTest#test_no_difference_between_identical_strands [hamming_test.rb:12]:\n    Expected: 0\n      Actual: nil\n\nUp until now we've been getting errors, this time we get a failure.\n\nAn error means that Ruby cannot even run properly because of things like missing\nfiles or syntax errors, or referring to things that don't exist.\n\nA failure is different—when you have a failure the Ruby is running just fine,\nbut the test is expecting one outcome, but getting another.\n\nThe test is expecting the `compute` method to return the number 0. The easiest way\nto make it pass, is to simply stick the number 0 inside the method definition.\n\n## Step 6\n\nRun the test again.\n\nIf it fails you're going to need to read the error message carefully to figure\nout what went wrong, and then try again.\n\nIf it passes, then you're ready to move to the next step.\n\nOpen the hamming_test.rb file, and find the word \"skip\". All but the first test\nstart with \"skip\", which tells Minitest to ignore the test. This is so that\nyou don't have to deal with all the failures at once.\n\nTo activate the next test, delete the \"skip\", and run the test suite again.\n\n## Wash, Rinse, Repeat\n\nDelete one \"skip\" at a time, and make each test pass before you move to the\nnext one.\n\n## Submit\n\nWhen everything is passing, you can submit your code with the following\ncommand:\n\n    $ exercism submit hamming.rb\n\n",

        "README.md": "# Hamming\n\nWrite a program that can calculate the Hamming difference between two DNA strands.\n\nA mutation is simply a mistake that occurs during the creation or\ncopying of a nucleic acid, in particular DNA. Because nucleic acids are\nvital to cellular functions, mutations tend to cause a ripple effect\nthroughout the cell. Although mutations are technically mistakes, a very\nrare mutation may equip the cell with a beneficial attribute. In fact,\nthe macro effects of evolution are attributable by the accumulated\nresult of beneficial microscopic mutations over many generations.\n\nThe simplest and most common type of nucleic acid mutation is a point\nmutation, which replaces one base with another at a single nucleotide.\n\nBy counting the number of differences between two homologous DNA strands\ntaken from different genomes with a common ancestor, we get a measure of\nthe minimum number of point mutations that could have occurred on the\nevolutionary path between the two strands.\n\nThis is called the 'Hamming distance'.\n\nIt is found by comparing two DNA strands and counting how many of the\nnucleotides are different from their equivalent in the other string.\n\n    GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT\n    CATCGTAATGACGGCCT\n    ^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^\n\nThe Hamming distance between these two DNA strands is 7.\n\n# Implementation notes\n\nThe Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length. This means\nthat based on the definition, each language could deal with getting sequences\nof equal length differently.\n\nYou will need the Minitest gem. To install it, open a\nterminal window and run:\n\n    gem install minitest\n\n## Source\n\nThe Calculating Point Mutations problem at Rosalind [view source](http://rosalind.info/problems/hamm/)\n"
